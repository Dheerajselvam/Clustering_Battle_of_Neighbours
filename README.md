# Clustering_Battle_of_Neighbours
Made Case study on comparing which city is better to immigrate to.
Performed feature engineering and feature selection and used foursquare APIs to get details of hotspot location like pubs, store, etc.
Using Folium maps and KNN made a interactive side by side map for the two cities, which also uses Agglomerative clustering while zooming in and out.
